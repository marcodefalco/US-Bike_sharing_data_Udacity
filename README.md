# US-Bike_sharing_data_Udacity
A short exploration of the US bike sharing data from the Udacity nanodegree program

This project was part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The first part of the notebook, as you can see, it had been facilitated for me.
The second part of the notebook was one of my very first attempt to data analysis and exploration.

Again, this is not serious work, just part of my early portfolio, which I deem to be worthy a GitHub upload.
